# Sorting
These are all in-place sorting algorithms, meaning I have an array and I sort by doing a swap.

## Worse than O(n^2) Sorting Algorithms
* Monkey Sort   O(n!)
* Slow Sort     O(n^logn)

## O(n^2) Sorting Algorithms

* Bubble Sort
* Cocktail Sort
* Odd-Even Sort
* Selection Sort
* Insertion Sort
* Cycle Sort
* Gnome Sort
* Shell Sort

## O(nlogn) Sorting Algorithms

* Quick Sort
* Merge Sort
* Heap Sort
* Radix Sort
* Bitonic Sort          -
* Intro Sort            -
* qsort (in-built in C)

Note: if there is a "-" next to the name it means my implementation of the algorithm that bugs
