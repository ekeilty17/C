# Useful
In C there are a lot of things you have to do manually that other programming languages would do automatically. This repository contains files with functions that do useful things.

## Arrays
A lot of what makes C hard to those who are new to programming is the distinction between an array and a list and dynamic versus static memory allocation. Most of my functions are simply dealing with various tedious cases of using multi-dimensional, dynamically allocated arrays.

* Implement a dynamic array (a list), i.e. can change size automatically
* Allocate memory to arrays up to 5d
* Free dynamically allocated arrays up to 5d
* Copying 1d, 2d, and 3d arrays where the copied array can be returned via the return statement or the argument list.
* Flatten a 2d and 3d array to a 1d array
* Print both multi-dim arrays and flattened multi-dim arrays up to 3d


## Miscellaneous

* Create common masks for Bitwise operations
* Implement a null-terminated-string
* Swap the value of two variables
* Getting data from a text file or user input
