# C
A repository of everything interesting I have created in the langauge C. Since C is a very low level language, I rarely use it to solve programming problems. C only needs to be used when code needs to be efficient. Therefore, I have created working libraries of various data structures, searching algorithms, sorting algorithms, and other generally useful blocks of code so that if I ever need to something in C that is efficient, I have quick access to the tools to do so.

## Data Structures

### Common Types of Data Structures

* Stack
* Queue
* Linked List
* Doubly Linked List
* Dictionary
* Heap (Priority Queue)
* Hash Table
* Graph

### Trees

* General Tree
* Binary Tree
* Converting between Binary and General Trees
* AVL Tree
* Cartesian Tree
* Red-Black Tree
* Suffix Tree 

## Searching

* Binary Search
* Linear Search

## Sorting

### Worse than O(n^2) Sorting Algorithms

* Monkey Sort   O(n!)
* Slow Sort     O(n^logn)

### O(n^2) Sorting Algorithms

* Bubble Sort
* Cocktail Sort
* Odd-Even Sort
* Selection Sort
* Insertion Sort
* Cycle Sort
* Gnome Sort
* Shell Sort

### O(nlogn) Sorting Algorithms

* Quick Sort
* Merge Sort
* Heap Sort
* Radix Sort
* Bitonic Sort
* Intro Sort
* qsort (in-built in C)

## Useful

### Arrays

* Implement a dynamic array (a list), i.e. can change size automatically
* Allocate memory to arrays up to 5d
* Free dynamically allocated arrays up to 5d
* Copying 1d, 2d, and 3d arrays where the copied array can be returned via the return statement or the argument list.
* Flatten a 2d and 3d array to a 1d array
* Print both multi-dim arrays and flattened multi-dim arrays up to 3d

### Miscellaneous

* Create common masks for Bitwise operations
* Implement a null-terminated-string
* Swap the value of two variables
* Getting data from a text file or user input
