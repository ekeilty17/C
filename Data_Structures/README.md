# C
A repository of useful tools and data structures I've made in C. The purpose of this repository is to have a library of useful and working data structures. 

## Common Tyes Data Structures

* Stack
* Queue
* Linked List
* Doubly Linked List
* Dictionary
* Heap (Priority Queue)
* Hash Table
* Graph

## Trees
There are many data structures that are some variation of binary trees. I have implemented several of those data structures, a general tree data structure, and converting between them. Below is a list of those data structures. The "-" indicate they are still in progress.

* General Tree
* Binary Tree
* Converting between Binary and General Trees
* AVL Tree
* Cartesian Tree                                -
* Red-Black Tree                                -
* Suffix Tree                                   -
